# intro

Pixel = **Pic**ture **El**ement
Three fundamental Tasks

+ Modeling
+ Animation(Simulating)
+ Rendering(displaying)

## Modeling
Digital Representation of the world
+ Digital Images
+ 3D Geometric Objects (Graphics)
+ Symbolic Descriptions

Three important and complex attributes
+ Shape
+ Visual look or appearance
+ Dynamic behaviors due to interactions with other elements of the world

## Simulating the behaviors of objects in the world
